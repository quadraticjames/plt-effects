\section*{Original Aims of the Project}

To formalise the semantics of algebraic effects, a proposed addition to OCaml, as a CEK machine, in order to perform subsequent random and exhaustive testing of concurrent schedules in the program. The testing should allow us to show desirable properties such as determinism and absence of deadlock.
